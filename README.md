# Replacing RAM Module on a Windows PC

**Replacing a RAM memory module is a necessary fix for computers suffering from slow application loading, multitasking, and even crashes or data corruption. This process requires powering off the computer and knowing where the RAM modules are located on the computer's motherboard. A memory tester tool is recommended to verify which RAM module stick is failing and that the stick you're using as the replacement will work.**

## Key Terms:
- **RAM**: Random Access Memory is a computer's short-term memory component that stores data for applications currently running, allowing quick access to information. The more RAM a computer has, the more amount of tasks a computer can handle at once.
- **DDR5**: DDR5 is the latest generation of Double Data Rate RAM that is capable of higher speeds, bandwidth, and power efficiency compared to previous generations like *DDR4*. It is important to verify if the RAM memory module in use is compatible with the computer's motherboard.
- **Memory Tester**: A physical tool that is used for checking a computer's RAM for any performance issues that could cause slow performance or crashes. It is a useful tool for identifying which RAM stick is failing and if a RAM stick is working correctly.
- **Motherboard**: A motherboard is the computer's circuit board that connects all its components, including RAM. It is accessible through opening a computer's case where various components can be replaced or upgraded based on the user's needs.
- **BIOS**: Basic Input/Output System, or BIOS, is the motherboard's firmware that detects hardware components like RAM and loads the computer's operating system. It executes a power-on-self-test, or POST, to check if there are any issues with the hardware then loads the operating system.

## Required Tools:
- **Screwdriver**: An appropriate screwdriver (usually a Phillips head) is needed to open and close the computer case.
- **Anti-static wrist strap**: This accessory ensures a technician's safety when working on the hardware of a computer.
- **Memory Tester**: This tool will diagnose whether or not individual RAM module sticks are faulty or good to use in a computer.
- **RAM Module sticks**: The actual computer component in question. A replacement RAM stick will be necessary to replace the faulty RAM stick.

## Expected Outcomes:
1. The faulty RAM module stick will fail on the memory tester tool. The replacement RAM module stick will pass.
2. The computer will detect the new RAM module stick. This can be verified in BIOS before loading Windows.
3. Various tasks will be tested such as web browsing, using video editing software, playing computer games, or running virtual machines simultaneously to verify the computer is able to perform these tasks without any slowdown or crashes.

## Troubleshooting Steps:

### Step 1: Power off the computer and prepare your tools
1. Make sure all the required tools are in hand: screwdriver, wrist strap, memory tester, and new RAM sticks.
- You may need to verify which generation(s) of RAM is compatible with the motherboard. For example, if the motherboard supports DDR4 RAM, the replacement RAM module stick should not be a new generation DDR5 RAM.
- Consult the manual of the computer's motherboard to verify what types of RAM are compatible and make sure your replacement RAM module stick will be compatible.
2. Shut down the computer and unplug the power cable. Make sure to discharge any remaining power.
3. Wear the anti-static wrist strap to ensure your safety. It prevents static discharge from damaged components.

### Step 2: Open the computer case and remove faulty RAM
1. Open the computer case using the screwdriver and locate the RAM modules on the motherboard.

2. Push down on the clips at each end of the RAM module sticks to remove them from the motherboard.

### Step 3: Test the old and new RAM
1. Plug in the memory tester tool and test each RAM module stick to verify which stick is failing. One of them should fail the test.

2. Separate the faulty RAM module stick from any that have passed the memory test. Take the replacement RAM module stick and use the memory tester to make sure it will work once it is installed. It should pass the test.

### Step 4: Install replacement RAM
1. Holding the new RAM by the edges, align the stick with the RAM slot on the motherboard.

2. Push down on both ends with equal force on the stick until the clips on both sides click.

### Step 5: Close the computer case and power on the computer
1. Close the computer case with your screwdriver, plug in the power cable, and power on the computer.

2. Access BIOS when the Windows logo appears by pressing the key that loads it (typically F2 or F10). It may differ depending on the computer's manufacturer.

3. Navigate to the memory settings and verify that your memory size matches the amount of RAM sticks installed on the motherboard. The exact path to finding it may vary depending on the manufacturer of the motherboard and their BIOS UI.

4. Alternatively, you can let the computer load Windows and navigate from the start search bar and type "About your PC". It will list the device specifications, including how much RAM is installed.

### Step 6: Test the computer's performance

1. Test the computer's performance with the new RAM installed by performing many tasks simultaneously:
- Use a web browser and open many tabs. Google Chrome is especially known for its usage of memory so that would be the recommended option.
- Play a computer game.
- Use a video editing software like Vegas Pro.
- Run a virtual machine.
- These applications that tend to take up memory space, so see if there are any slowdowns or crashes while running these tasks at the same time.
- If there doesn't seem to be any issues, the computer will handle any tasks the user will need.

## Conclusion:
**Replacing RAM is a straightforward process once a technician is familiar with PC building. Memory is an important component to computer use, especially when a user requires high multitasking performance for work or personal projects. While testing the new RAM modules after installation verifies that the computer can handle high performance, it is diligent to follow up with a customer to confirm that the new RAM continues to work well with their needs. It is also wise for a technician to have backup RAM module sticks in hand so they are immediately available for any customer who may need them without having to wait for a new order to arrive**
