# Replacing RAM Module on a Windows PC

**Replacing a RAM memory module is a necessary fix for computers suffering from slow application loading, multitasking, and even crashes or data corruption. This process requires powering off the computer and knowing where the RAM modules are located on the computer's motherboard. A memory tester tool is recommended to verify which RAM module stick is failing and that the stick you're using as the replacement will work.**

## Key Terms:
- **RAM**: Random Access Memory is a computer's short-term memory component that stores data for applications currently running, allowing quick access to information. The more RAM a computer has, the more amount of tasks a computer can handle at once.
- **DDR5**: DDR5 is the latest generation of Double Data Rate RAM that is capable of higher speeds, bandwidth, and power efficiency compared to previous generations like *DDR4*. It is important to verify if the RAM memory module in use is compatible with the computer's motherboard.
- **Memory Tester**: A physical tool that is used for checking a computer's RAM for any performance issues that could cause slow performance or crashes. It is a useful tool for identifying which RAM stick is failing and if a RAM stick is working correctly.

**Replacing a RAM memory module conists of powering off the computer and preparing your workspace along with making sure all power is discharged. Next, open the computer case and push down on the clips at each end of the RAM stick to release the old RAM module. Then after verifying that the new RAM module is compatible and passed the memory tester, push down both ends of the stick until the clips click in place. Finally, close the computer case, power the computer back on, and verify that the new RAM is detected in BIOS.**
